## What is blog?
Include both favicon.ico and favicon.svg files in your project to ensure your siteâ€™s favicons display correctly.

While favicon.ico is generally for older browsers, favicon.svg is supported by modern ones. The optional favicon-dark.svg can be included for a tailored experience in dark mode. Feel free to use tools like favicon.io or favycon to generate these icons.
