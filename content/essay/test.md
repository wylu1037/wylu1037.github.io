Things you may want to cover:

Ruby version 3.2.2

Configuration Add your env variables to the config/credentials.yml.enc file. You can do this by running bin/rails credentials:edit

Database creation Locally we use sqlite3 as our database. This is already set up for you. In production make sure your DATABASE_URL env variable is set. We use PostgreSQL in production.

Database initialization run bin/rails db:migrate to create the tables
